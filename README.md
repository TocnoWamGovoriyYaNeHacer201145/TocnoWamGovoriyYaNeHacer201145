I'm a beginner Python developer (I've been learning it for 1 year), 
now I'm also trying C and writing programs for fun or making lighter versions of tools 
for those who aren't programmers or don't understand code.

# How did I find out about GitHub?
It's a fun moment when I tried to log in to my account in Minecraft (Microsoft) and 
saw an option to log in with GitHub, ended up registering here, but every year I started using it more and more. 

# What am I doing in the community now?
- Translating Node.js from English into Russian at Crowdin.
- Developing the USharp, RANDG, OSHD and Lua-minus language (although no one will know about them).

## Am I ready to do a project with someone? 
- No at the moment.

## What modules do I know? 
- At the moment, I know turtle and optimum well (because I was interested in Neural Networks at one time).
