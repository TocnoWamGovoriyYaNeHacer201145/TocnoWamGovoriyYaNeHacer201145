# Hi there!

I'm a beginner Python developer, a fan of creating interpreters of programming languages (don't be surprised if you find a lot of them in my profile). On top of that, I'm also trying a little bit of [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) (fun fact: I live in a city on the island after which this language is named) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

## What projects am I currently working on?

I am currently developing several of my programming languages, but I want to focus on the development of one of them. Since I'm still learning, I often find it difficult to combine learning and programming, but so far, as you can see, I'm holding on. But okay, the whole list of them:

- [DupSpace](https://github.com/TocnoWamGovoriyYaNeHacer201145/DupSpace)
- [OSHD](https://github.com/TocnoWamGovoriyYaNeHacer201145/oshd-lang)
- [U#](https://github.com/TocnoWamGovoriyYaNeHacer201145/USharp)
- [RANDG](https://github.com/TocnoWamGovoriyYaNeHacer201145/RANDG)
- ~~Lua-minus~~

## How did I find out about GitHub?

It's a bit of a funny story, I first learned about the existence of Github at an early age, when I was playing Minecraft when I logged in to my Microsoft account I saw the opportunity to log in from Github. And then years later, I started programming and using this as my favorite platform.

## Respect from me to these projects

- [F#](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp)
- [Clojure](https://github.com/clojure/clojure)
- [lbForth](https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/lbForth)
- [Lua](https://github.com/lua/lua)

## A few more catches from me

Thanks to everyone who makes open-source projects, it really helps many users in the implementation of their own ideas. Without you, I don't know what would have happened to the world...
